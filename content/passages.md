## 2. *Coming in for a Landing*  
by **Dean W. Ball**  
[Original post link](https://substack.com/home/post/p-172844395)

> I’m here to speak with you about technology and the future of the family. I feel I must speak to you about the future more broadly. For there is no institution in human history more intrinsically forward-looking than the family, no institution more deeply predicated on the notion that the future will be better than the present.  
>   
> If we knew the future were to be bleak, it would not be worth living to see. Why would anyone go through the trouble of childrearing, of cultivating a young mind, if they did not believe the future would have anything to offer that child?  
>   
> If we did not believe in a bright future, there would be little sense in building a family, or anything at all. The only purpose left would be procuring our daily fix of dopamine.  
>   
> This, I think, is the fundamental sickness afflicting the Western world today: we have lost our belief that the future will be worth being a part of. Suicide of all sorts—the visceral, literal kind and the slow, civilizational kind—is being committed all around us. We see it in the abstract statistics, in the nihilistic social media and the other addictions of our people, in the endless self-flagellation of our chattering classes and media, and in the self-imposed deindustrialization in whose shadow we now live.  
>   
> It is no wonder, then, that Western fertility has fallen off a cliff.

## 3. Excerpt from *🌻 America Against China Against America*  
by **Jasmine Sun**  
[Original post link](https://jasmi.news/p/china-2025?r=f2r08&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=substack)

> No word appeared in conversation more often than neijuan (内卷), or “involution.” The term was popularized in 2020 among Chinese social media users, though it was supposedly first adapted by online intellectual Liu Zhongjing (who Afra described as “the Curtis Yarvin of China”) from anthropologist Clifford Geertz’s book on rice farming in Indonesia. Quoting Yi-Ling Liu’s New Yorker piece on the topic:  
>   
> Geertz’s theory of involution holds that a greater input (an increase in labor) does not yield proportional output (more crops and innovation)... Involution is “the experience of being locked in competition that one ultimately knows is meaningless,” Biao told me. It is acceleration without a destination, progress without a purpose, Sisyphus spinning the wheels of a perpetual-motion Peloton.  
>   
> Chinese solar companies battling to the death? Involution. High schoolers spending Saturdays out-prepping each other for the gaokao? Involution. Six hotpot restaurants side-by-side on a single mall floor? Involution. Boba delivery that somehow costs less than pickup? Dance, dance, involution.  
>   
> Involution initially seemed like a uniquely Chinese phenomenon. But the more I thought about it, the more I noticed involution in modern America as well. AI model providers pouring billions in to outcompete each other by 0.1% gains on benchmarks that consumers will never see, college graduates applying to hundreds of entry-level software jobs to land a single interview, urbanites spending hours optimizing Hinge prompts only to get ghosted by a situationship.  
>   
> A recent piece by Delia Cai argues that American zoomers are “the most rejected generation.” Increasing competition, decreasing returns. It’s no wonder that cynicism starts to set in.

## 4. Excerpt from *The Paradox of China’s Pessimism*  
Conversation between **Afra Wang and Du Lei**

> **Afra:** China's "indefinite and pessimistic sentiment" often confuses me and I've been contemplating its roots. When visiting China, you experience impressive infrastructure and consumption options that are noticeably more abundant, higher quality, and futuristic than those in Europe and America. The surface prosperity is undeniable. Each time I take the high-speed train, I'm genuinely impressed and never take it for granted. Given China's remarkable achievements, why does EVERYONE I meet continue to harbor such profound pessimism? One possible explanation is: you never know when the iron fist (铁拳) from the state will come down. This feeling that it could strike at any time creates constant tension, much like playing Russian roulette.  
>   
> **Du Lei:** What you said is exactly my reaction when thinking about this. I'm trying to find a more tactful, gentler way to express this viewpoint. I think certainty about the future might be the key OS difference between the two sides.  
>   
> America also faces uncertainty, but its basic governance logic is very bottom-up. In a strongly bottom-up system, every participant has greater agency. With stronger agency, people think: "Even though I'm uncertain about the future, I can remain optimistic because I always have multiple chances. If I don't win this round, I can try again."  
>   
> But in a very top-down model like China, success or failure often doesn't depend on individual actions, but on which side you stand. Top-down decisions directly determine your fate in this game played with a visible hand. In this situation, all participants lack agency. People think: "As a whole, China will definitely win, but as an individual, I'm not sure if I'll be the tears of the era or a sacrifice."  
>   
> In China, everyone believes the state will ultimately succeed, but no one knows whether they'll be the victor or the price paid for victory.
