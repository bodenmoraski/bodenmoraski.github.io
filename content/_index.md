Hi — I'm Boden! I'm currently a student at Shady Side Academy, and am broadly interested in exploring how we can use our understanding of the world to improve the future.

I currently co-run the [Center for Youth and AI](https://youth-ai.org), a national AI Advocacy organization, am researching AI's impacts on civic reasoning at [Sway](https://www.swaybeta.ai/home) out of Carnegie Mellon University, among other [commitments](/experience/). Most of my public writing lives on my [Substack](https://bodenmoraski.substack.com/).
