I have a range of interests, but right now I'm especially interested in moral philosophy, AI safety, and the broad question of how we can make the future better. I'm currently a student at Shady Side Academy and serve as Co-Executve Director at the Center for Youth and AI.  

## Current Work

I'm currently a student at Shady Side Academy and serve as Co-Executve Director at the Center for Youth and AI, among other commitments. You can see a more comprehensive list of my experience [here](/experience/).

## Research and Work Interests

Right now I'm primarily interested in [AI Safety](https://www.anthropic.com/news/core-views-on-ai-safety). Technically, I'm most interested in [scalable oversight](https://bluedot.org/blog/scalable-oversight-intro) and [risk and capabilities benchmarking](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/chapters/05). I also believe that governance, advocacy, and community-building in AI Safety are all crucial to support and complement these research directions.

I'm also interested in [ethical frameworks](https://aese.psu.edu/teachag/curriculum/modules/bioethics-1/what-are-ethical-frameworks) and how they interact and arise in both biological and artificial systems.

# Broader Interests

Adjacent to these interests and work, I am interested in and have previously engaged with [social simulation and modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_simulation), especially around [political polarization](https://www.populismstudies.org/Vocabulary/political-polarization), [moral uncertainty](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-decision-uncertainty/), [theodicies](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/theodicies), [behavioral economics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/behavioraleconomics.asp#:~:text=Behavioral%20economics%20is%20the%20study%20of%20psychology%20that%20analyzes%20the,%2C%20discrimination%2C%20and%20herd%20mentality.), and [information theory](https://www.britannica.com/science/information-theory). I always welcome hearing from anyone interested in these topics.

## Get in Touch

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow researchers, builders, and anyone passionate about AI, ethics, or education. [Reach out here](/contact/) or email me at bodenmoraski [at] gmail.com.
