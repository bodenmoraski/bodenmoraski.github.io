 - Imagine you're now on the plane home again but the camp didn't go extraordinarily well. What would have happened?
     - spent too much time by myself
     - didn't engage as much with others, didn't learn but about them or their interests
     - didn't meet any interesteing people or talk about AI Safety / my interests at all

 - What do yu think this camp is about?
     - learning about AI Systems and how they are relevant to the world
     - improving our reasoning capabilities and learning new methods for understanding the world
     - equipping ourselves with the necessary tools to contribute in a positive manner to modern society, especiay surrounding AI andepistemic reasoning. 

 - What do you want the camp to be for you?
     - Learning vicariously and enjoying the content
     - growing in mind, body, spirit.
     - exploring the perspectives of others to help inform my worldview and allow me to empathize with them to a greater extent
     - gain some foundational skills to contribute in AI Safety

 - if I said "I know what's up wth AI and the world", would that be true?
     - Generally, I think so

    What are you confused about?
     - majority/mainstream intellectual views on AI Risk. I fear I'm in a rationalist/AI Safety bubble where I only see ~2 perspectives
     - how AXI Dev might influence geopolitics (need to re-read situational awareness ngl)

     What are you most curious about?
      - how I can effectively get more capabilities ppl interested in safety work
      - what are the most promising safety research directions form our availible information?
      - do i even know anything about AI Safety? About AI? How important are deep technical skills and knowledge?

 - What can you learn from each other?
     - how views on ai safety have evolved or are evolving
     - just get generally a better picture of the world, understand intl perspectives more
     - perhaps get better at socializing with large and diverse groups of ppl

 - What do you want to talk about?

     - AI Safety, futures, forecasts, etc
     - how new news and capabilites trends play in to AI futures, how differnet perspectives are reascting
     - how philisophcial frameowrks might tie into AI development and embodiment / consciousness
     - generlaly iinteresting philsoophy and basic meaning arguements sound exciting to me
     - the small technical details that seem unnecessary to discuss at such legnth but end up being very useful
     - new rationality techniques and mental models of the world
